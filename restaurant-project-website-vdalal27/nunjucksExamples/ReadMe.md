# Nunjucks Templating Library Examples

This directory contains several examples illustrating the
[nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks). We will start with
just a couple examples and hopefully will add more as we go on.

1. `test1.js` -- About the simplest example possible, simple variable
 substitutions. Taken from the nunjucks documentation with additional code for
 use with Node.js.

2. `fileRender1.js` -- Get the data to be used from a JSON file, gets the
template to be used from a *views* directory, renders it and then writes it to
a file in the *output* directory.

3. `NobelPrizes.js` -- Uses data for Nobel prizes to produce a number of linked files displayling different categories of prizes over a selected range of years. Note that there is a student branch to enable this as a homework assignment.
